    <h1>CHAOS</h1>
    <h3> primeval state of existence, the initial void from which everything emerged.
      It is the most fundamental aspect of the cosmos, preceding even the gods themselves. 
      Chaos is often depicted as a formless, yawning chasm or abyss, from which the first gods and elements of the universe originated.

      <ul>Cronus, one of the Titans, overthrew his father Uranus and became the ruler of the cosmos.</ul>
      <ul>However, he feared a prophecy that foretold he would be overthrown by one of his own children, so he swallowed each of his offspring upon birth.</ul>
      <ul> Rhea, Cronus's wife, managed to save one of her children, Zeus, by tricking Cronus into swallowing a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.</ul>
      <ul>Zeus was then raised in secret on the island of Crete</ul>
      <ul>When Zeus grew up, he challenged Cronus and the Titans for control of the universe.</ul>
      <ul>This resulted in a great war known as the Titanomachy.</ul>
